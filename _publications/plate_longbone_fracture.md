## INTRODUCTION
======
<div style="text-align:justify"> A circuit will be designed to simulate the lights of a traffic light based on a 4040 frequency divider, an And gate that will serve to reset the system, an Eprom memory that will be programmed in HxD so that it can work correctly, three LEDs that represent the status of the traffic light and finally a seven-segment BCD encoder with a seven-segment common anode display to show the remaining seconds of the status. </div>
