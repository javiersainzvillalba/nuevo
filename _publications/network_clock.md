## INTRODUCTION
<div style="text-align:justify"> A table clock will be designed that will display the hour, minutes and seconds. It is called a network clock because the time base will be obtained through the frequency available in the 230V AC socket. It will display the seven segments that show the data in BCD code. A system to set the clock in time will be implemented. This proyect will consist of three perfectly differentiated sections.</div>
